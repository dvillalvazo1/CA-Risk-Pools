Membership verified from Northern California Cities Meetings and Agenda documentation. 

From FYs 2014-2015 to 2023-2024 

N = 22 

Information gathered manually from NCCSIF website: https://www.nccsif.org/meeting-agendas/. I specifically looked at all meeting agendas from "Police Risk Management Committee" Agenda/ meeting minute notes. This allowed me to see all 22 cities part of this fund from this time frame. Data gathered on 12/31/2025. Note, that during this time period, no risk pools joined or left the risk pool. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Define fiscal years and cities
fys <- paste0(2014:2023, "-", 2015:2024)  # FY 2014-2015 to 2023-2024
cities <- c(
  "Anderson", "Auburn", "Colusa", "Corning", "Dixon", "Elk Grove",
  "Folsom", "Galt", "Gridley", "Ione", "Jackson", "Lincoln",
  "Marysville", "Nevada", "Oroville", "Paradise", "Placerville",
  "Red Bluff", "Rio Vista", "Rocklin", "Willows", "Yuba City"
)

# Create dataframe with all combinations
membership_df <- expand.grid(fy = fys, city = cities) %>%
  arrange(fy, city)

# View first few rows
head(membership_df)

table(membership_df$city)

write.csv(membership_df, file = "northern_ca_cities_rp.csv")
